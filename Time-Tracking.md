## Settings

### 1. Show Relative Time

(Default Off) When enabled, instead of showing you what time your harvest will be ready ("Done at 17:40"), it will show you how long until your harvest is ready ("Done in 1h 30m").

### 2. Show plan patch state
When enabled, it will show you an empty state if no plants in the patch are growing and a ready state if the plants in the patch are done growing and ready to be harvested.
